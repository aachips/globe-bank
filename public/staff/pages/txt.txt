header($string);
header("Content-Type: applicatoin/pdf");
header("HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found");
header("HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error");

Headers are sent before all other page data. Changes must bve made before any HTML output. Even before a single space, line return, whitespace in included files, or after whitespace inside PHP tags. Headers must come first.
Any changes must come before modifying any data.

Page Redirection
302 redirect;
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: path
    header("Location: login.php");

Example:
User submits user and password on loginPhp code checks user credentials
If its corerct, user sent to success page. If incorrect, sent to failure page

Page redirects are sent in headers. which are sent before page data. Header changes must be made before any HTML output
Page redicts must be sent before any HTML output

Output Buffering
Data in output buffer is editable. Headers can be changed. Whitespace can be sent before header edits and redirect.

Turn on buffering in php.ini file. Often on by default.  use phpinfo(); buffering enabled in characters. 4096 is good amount. 
4096 characters before headers get dumped into web Server

from php code ob_start()
ob_end_flush() - flush results into web server

Best to turn output buffering on in php.ini. Use ob_start when code may be ported to other servers. Rare we will need to flush manually.
Turn ob start on at start of initialize.php

Build Forms = most common ways
URLs/Links
Forms
GET
POSt

Use Form Parameters
    In superglobal variable: $_POST
    same as $_GET
    assigned by PHP before processing page code
    Do not need to encode form paramaters

$name = $_POST['name'];
$name = isset($_POST['name']) ? $_POST['name'] : ";
$n = $_POST['name'] ?? "; // PHP > 7.0
